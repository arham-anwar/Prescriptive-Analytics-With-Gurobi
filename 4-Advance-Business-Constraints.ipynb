In Problem 2.3 of the previous quiz, you solved the problem where BalancedMilk wanted to optimize its transportation costs and pollution (CO2 emission). In this problem, we want to model situations where BalancedMilk plans its milk distribution considering different forms of pollution tax.\n",

Therefore, all supply centers are available to supply milk to each demand market. **Also, in this problem, we impose the constraint that the total milk delivered to a demand market must be equal to its demand - neither more nor less.** If you pay attention to the Supply vector, you can see that the total supply is now more than the total demand. Nevertheless, logically, **no supply center can supply more than its capacity.**\n",

    "\n",
    "As you have seen in many malls, there can be some cafeterias in the corridors. In this question, we want to know if we should add cafeteria(s) to our mall. Our mall has 1,000 $m^2$ of shared space in the corridors. Notice that this shared space is independent of that 15,000 $m^2$ of the floorplan. That means adding cafeteria(s) to the mall does not reduce the total area for other stores/facilities. Also, not having a cafeteria does not increase the total area for other stores/facilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding cafeteria(s) to the mall has multiple effects:\n",
    "1. Each cafeteria requires 200 $m^2$ of the shared space. Since there is 1,000 $m^2$ shared space in the mall that can be allocated to cafeterias, we can have up to 5 cafeterias. However, there are some additional safety concerns and taxes due to the congestion in the corridors. The following table shows the number of cafeterias and the corresponding annual tax:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Number of Cafeterias | Tax (\\$) |\n",

    "| 4 | 50,000 |\n",
    "| 5 | 100,000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that the above table shows the total tax for all cafeterias. For example, if we have 3 cafeterias, the total tax is 20,000 dollars, not 60,000 dollars.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Due to the diminishing return to scale, the total profit from cafeterias is not simply the number of cafeterias multiplied by the expected annual profit of each cafeteria. Instead, the total profit coming from cafeterias is in the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Number of Cafeterias | Total Profit (\\$) |\n",
    "| :--: | :--: |\n",
    "| 0 | 0 |\n",

    "| 4 | 1,600,000 |\n",
    "| 5 | 1,650,000 |\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If the number of cafeterias is 3 or more, the number of Type B restaurants cannot be more than 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with the possibility of adding cafeterias to the mall, and just with the two fundamental constraints, **find and print the optimal expected annual profit and the optimal number of cafeterias.** "

    "## The (True) Story:\n",
    "Between June 24th and 26th, the 2023 INFORMS MSOM Conference was held at Mont Royal Center, hosted by McGill's Desautels faculty of management. The conference was a great success, and the organizing committee was pleased with the outcome. However, the success of the conference was not a coincidence. The organizing committee had to work over the clock to make it happen. In this part, we want to solve a problem that the organizing committee of this conference (and any organizing team of any conference or exhibition) faces: **How to assign volunteers to different tasks?** Here, we model this situation as an allocation problem and solve it using Gurobi. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: In all the following questions, each volunteer can be assigned to at most one task on each day. However, a volunteer can be assigned to different types of tasks during the conference, as long as they are not on the same day.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data:\n",
    "In this problem, we have 10 candidate volunteers (all graduate students) and several tasks. Since volunteers are not professional conference organizers, their performance varies among different tasks. If a volunteer is assigned to a task with the required skills, they can execute the task more efficiently and reliably. Additionally, volunteers who participate in the conference can attend the talks and workshops for free. This means while the attendance fee for the conference is 500 dollars, the volunteers do not pay the fee, which means a potential loss of 500 dollars for the organizing committee for each volunteer. Therefore, it may not be optimal for the organizing committee to recruit all the candidates. "

Either a volunteer is recruited (and the organization committee endures the cost) and can be assigned tasks on those three days, or they are not recruited (and the organization committee does not pay the cost) and cannot be assigned to any task.\n",

Model this as a hierarchical multi-objective optimization problem, where the top priority is minimizing the recruiting cost, and the second priority is maximizing the total performance score. Adjust your code from Question 9 to solve this problem. **Report the optimal recruiting cost and the optimal performance score.**\n",
